 

Two programs with some parameters passed by name and asked to output.

No program that we would need to write from scratch to pass by name. 


static variable -- a varialbe that retains its value throughout function calls 

Passing by Value
Passing by name
Passing by Reference -- involves pointers 

Passing by name and passing by reference is the 'same' thing... but its slightly different. 

1. Passing of parameters by Value
    A local copy of a variable in main is created locally within the function definition 

2. Pass by name (reference)
    Use of ampersand (&), and helps the parameter refer to the same memory location. 
    Therefore, use of references can use void return function. 


Random Number Generation 

rand() -- this function generates a pseudo-random Number
    "scaling a random number" 

    say HEADS or TAILS

a = ran() == % 2; //requires #include <cstd...> function 
    //will return 0 or 1. 


/* Heads and Tails Program ****/





----
#include <iomanip>

<< setw( 13 ) // this cout function basically aligns all output values. 
//WILL BE ON EXAM
